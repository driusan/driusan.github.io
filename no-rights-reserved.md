I'm under no illusions that there's anything groundbreaking on this site, so I hereby place all content on it into the public domain.

You can do what you want with it. Copy it entirely or partially, unmodified or modified. Profit from it, go broke from it. Quote it with proper attribution, misattribute anything on it to Shakespeare, don't attribute it to anyone at all and pretend it's your own. I don't care.

You can [fork it](https://github.com/driusan/driusan.github.io) on github and fix any typos then send a pull request, or keep the fixes to yourself. It's up to you.
