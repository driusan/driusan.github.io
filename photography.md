I used to enjoy doing a lot of photography. Last year (2013) I tried to take a photo every day for the entire year, but I burned out before finishing and haven't done very much photography since.

I shoot with a Nikon D600, and prefer a 50mm lens. One of these days, I'll probably get back into it, but in the meantime, you may want to look at [my flickr gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/driusan/).
