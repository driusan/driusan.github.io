Aikido is a Japanese martial art founded by Morihei Ueshiba based on the idea of blending with, rather than confronting an attacker. Just about every dojo's web page has a history of aikido and it's philosophy, so I won' go into it here.

I practice at [McGill Aikido](http://www.mcgillaikido.com/), where I recently earned my 4th kyu and in between semesters I'm usually at [Montreal Aikikai](http://www.montrealaikikai.qc.ca/).

Eventually, this page will have a list of [seminars](aikido-seminars.html) I've attended and what I've learned at them.
