Aikido is a Japanese martial art founded by Morihei Ueshiba based on the idea of blending with, rather than confronting an attacker. Just about every dojo's web page has a history of aikido and it's philosophy, so I won't go into it here.

I practice at [McGill Aikido](http://www.mcgillaikido.com/), where I'm a 4th kyu student.

On [this page](aikido-seminars.html) you can find a list of seminars I've attended and what I learned at them.
