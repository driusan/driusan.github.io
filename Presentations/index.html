title: Dave's Presentations

<p>
This page contains a collection of some presentations I've given to my team
at work.
</p>
<p>They're generally introductions to certain new(ish) technologies oriented
towards the Loris and CBrain teams at <a href="http://www.mcin.ca">MCIN</a>,
but may still be informative if you're unfamiliar with them.
