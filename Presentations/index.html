title: Dave's Presentations
---
<p>
This page contains a collection of some presentations I've given to my team
at work.
</p>
<p>They're generally introductions to certain new(ish) technologies oriented
towards the Loris and CBrain teams at <a href="http://www.mcin.ca">MCIN</a>,
but may still be informative if you're unfamiliar with them. (I've done
many more than this, but only the ones I think might be interesting to a
wider audience are here..)
</p>
