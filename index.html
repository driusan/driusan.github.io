I am a software developer who works for the <a href="http://www.mcin.ca">McGill Centre For Integrative Neuroscience</a> at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>, where I mostly work on the <a href="https://github.com/aces/Loris">Loris</a> database for neuroinformatics. In particular, I rewrote their <a href="https://github.com/aces/Data-Query-Tool">data querying tool</a>  as a CouchApp based on <a href="http://www.couchdb.org">CouchDB</a> using HTML5 and javascript. 

<p>You might be interested in some of the <a href="/Presentations/">posters and presentations</a> I've prepared over the years.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy coding my <a href="https://github.com/driusan/bug">Distributed Bug Tracker</a> written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>.
<p>
My hobbies these days mostly involve <a href="aikido.html">aikido</a> and <a href="motorcycling.html">motorcycling</a>, but have at various times included <a href="photography.html">photography</a> and <a href="cycling.html">bicycling</a>.
</p>
<p>I've discovered <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and after 15 years of software development specializing in webapps, decided to use it for making a personal website, because it reminds me of simpler times and I'm starting to think this whole internet thing just might take off.
