I am a software developer who works for <a href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~alan/">Alan Evans'</a> lab at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>, where I mostly work on the <a href="https://github.com/aces/Loris">Loris</a> database for neuroinformatics. In particular, I rewrote their <a href="https://github.com/aces/DQG-2.0">data querying tool</a> (link may point to a private github repo until I can convince management to open source it) as a CouchApp based on <a href="http://www.couchdb.org">CouchDB</a> using HTML5 and javascript. I had a poster about it and how NoSQL was more efficient than MySQL for this purpose at the <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org">Organization for Human Brain Mapping 2014</a> conference.

My hobbies these days mostly involve <a href="aikido.html">aikido</a> and <a href="motorcycling.html">motorcycling</a>, but have at various times included <a href="photography.html">photography</a> and <a href="cycling.html">bicycling</a>.

<p>I've discovered <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and after 15 years of software development specializing in webapps, decided to use it for making a personal website, because it reminds me of simpler times and I'm starting to think this whole internet thing just might take off.
