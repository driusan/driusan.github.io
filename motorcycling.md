I drive an '83 Honda Shadow VT500c. Or at least, I'd like to. Quebec's licensing laws for motorcycle learners is so ridiculously strict that it makes it near impossible to get practice in until you get your full license, which I should be able to do this summer.

[Here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/driusan/9137304437/) is a picture of my bike. Once I can drive on my own, I should have more photos and stories to include here.
